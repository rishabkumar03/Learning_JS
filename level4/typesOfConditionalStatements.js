CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS IN JAVA:

    FOR LOOP: 
        - It is used when we know how many times, we have to run the loop.
        - This loop is best for fixed iterations and index control.

    WHILE LOOP:
        - It is used when we don't know the number of iterations before code.
        - This loop is best for unknown iterations and condition based statements.

    FOR OF LOOP:
        - It is used to loop over iterable objects (strings, arrays, maps, sets).
        - This loop is best for arrays, strings and iterables.

    FOR IN LOOP:
        - It is used to loop over keys (properties) of an object.
        - This loop is best for objects.

    FOR EACH LOOP:
        - It is used on arrays only, It runs a callback for each element.
        - This loop is best for arrays and provide clean functional styles.
